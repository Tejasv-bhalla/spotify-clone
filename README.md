## Project Description

This project is a front-end clone of Spotify's web player, created to showcase my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It emulates the visual and functional aspects of the official Spotify web player, offering users a seamless and engaging experience.

The site features a fully responsive design, ensuring compatibility across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Users can navigate through a selection of curated playlists and use the basic music player controls to play, pause, and skip tracks.

While this project does not include backend functionality such as user authentication or dynamic content loading, it effectively demonstrates my ability to design and develop a complex user interface with modern web technologies.
